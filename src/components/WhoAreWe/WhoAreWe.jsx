                <p>The original (somewhat brighter colors) have faded over the years, which gives a beautiful contemporary and unique effect.The vintage rugs and poufs are first professionally cleaned by us, after which they are given a new life in varying interior styles.With a moroccan rug or pouf you have a real eye catcher at home.</p>
